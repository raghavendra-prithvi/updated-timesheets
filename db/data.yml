      href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dianin\">Aleksandr Dianin</a>.
      In the 1930s, <span>Charles Edward Dodds discovered BPA behaved as an\r\nartificial
      estrogen. Early on, BPA was used to enhance growth in farm animals\r\nand also
      as an artificial estrogen replacement in humans, before it was\r\nreplaced by
      another compound.&nbsp;<br><br> </span>Some years after\r\nBPA’s discovery,
      it was found to be a useful additive to plastic. The\r\nchemical is currently
      used in everything from water bottles to can liners. Global production is expected
      to reach 6.3\r\nmillion metric tons by 20152.<br><br> So what is the big deal?
      Unfortunately\r\nfor us, BPA leaches from plastics, and it is widely used in
      food products.<br> Nearly all of us have a constant level\r\nof BPA in our bloorstream..
      Studies\r\nhave shown BPA to be linked to breast and\r\nprostate cancer, obesity,
      neurobehavioral problems, and reproductive\r\nabnormalities and obesity3.<br><br>In
      October\r\nof 2010, Canada declared BPA a toxin5. In 2009, the six largest US\r\ncompanies
      that produce baby bottles decided to stop using it in their baby\r\nbottles6.
      However, the chemical is\r\nstill used in nearly every canned product and water
      bottles, as well as other\r\nfood products.<br><br> <div>Last\r\nyear, the companies
      responsible feeding us these chemicals made in excess of 6\r\nBillion Dollars
      in profit (4.6 B euro (Bayer), 2B Dow)7. With\r\nexisting safe alternatives
      to BPA, industry should be required to eliminate\r\nthis harmful product from
      our shelves8. &nbsp;</div></div>"
